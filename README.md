# Morphological Classification of Cyanobacteria Using MobileNet and MobileNetV2

This repository presents two deep learning models to classify toxigenic cyanobacteria from RGB microscopic images based on their morphology:

- **MobileNet** model implemented in `mobilenet.ipynb`
- **MobileNetV2** model implemented in `mobilenetV2.ipynb`

Both models utilize transfer learning and are trained on RGB images of cyanobacteria to classify genera for water quality monitoring purposes.

> ‚úÖ Developed as part of the **Summer Semester Research Project** at **IIIT Naya Raipur**

## üìå Objective

- Classify cyanobacterial genera using RGB image morphology
- Compare MobileNet vs MobileNetV2 in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization
- Deploy a lightweight, real-time-capable model for microscopy image analysis

## üì¶ Dataset

Microscopic RGB images of toxigenic cyanobacteria genera were used. Due to data sharing restrictions, the original dataset is not public.

However, a similar dataset can be used for experimentation:

- üîó **[Algae Classification Dataset ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/algae-classification)**

This open dataset includes microscopic algae images suitable for morphological classification tasks.
