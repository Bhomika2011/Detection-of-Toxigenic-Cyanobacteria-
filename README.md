# Detection-of-Toxigenic-Cyanobacteria-
A deep learning-based approach to classify toxigenic cyanobacterial genera from RGB microscopic images using MobileNet and MobileNetV2 architectures. This project compares the performance of both models for real-time water quality monitoring based on morphological traits.
